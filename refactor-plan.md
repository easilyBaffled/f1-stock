    # Refactoring Plan

    This document outlines a plan to refactor the F1 Stock Market Simulator codebase to improve its quality, maintainability, and performance.

    ## Prioritized Tasks

    ### High Priority (1-2 Days)

    1.  **Component Reusability:**
        *   **Task:** Identify and refactor common UI patterns into reusable components (e.g., buttons, inputs, cards).
        *   **Goal:** Reduce code duplication and improve consistency across the application.
        *   **Timeline:** 1 day
    2.  **State Management Refinement:**
        *   **Task:** Review and optimize state management logic in Zustand stores.
        *   **Goal:** Ensure efficient state updates and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
        *   **Timeline:** 1 day

    ### Medium Priority (2-3 Days)

    1.  **API Integration:**
        *   **Task:** Replace the mock API with a real API for fetching news data.
        *   **Goal:** Provide real-time and accurate news updates.
        *   **Timeline:** 2 days
    2.  **Code Splitting:**
        *   **Task:** Implement code splitting to improve initial load time.
        *   **Goal:** Reduce the size of the initial JavaScript bundle.
        *   **Timeline:** 1 day

    ### Low Priority (3-5 Days)

    1.  **Testing:**
        *   **Task:** Implement unit and integration tests for core components and functionalities.
        *   **Goal:** Ensure code reliability and prevent regressions.
        *   **Timeline:** 2 days
    2.  **Performance Optimization:**
        *   **Task:** Profile the application and identify performance bottlenecks.
        *   **Goal:** Optimize rendering performance and reduce resource consumption.
        *   **Timeline:** 2 days
    3.  **Documentation:**
        *   **Task:** Improve code documentation and add comments where necessary.
        *   **Goal:** Make the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
        *   **Timeline:** 1 day

    ## Estimated Timelines

    *   **High Priority:** 1-2 days
    *   **Medium Priority:** 2-3 days
    *   **Low Priority:** 3-5 days

    ## Refactoring Steps

    1.  **Component Reusability:**
        *   Identify common UI patterns (e.g., buttons, inputs, cards).
        *   Create reusable components for these patterns.
        *   Replace existing instances with the new components.
    2.  **State Management Refinement:**
        *   Review state update logic in Zustand stores.
        *   Optimize state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
        *   Use selectors to derive data from the state.
    3.  **API Integration:**
        *   Research and select a suitable news API.
        *   Implement API calls to fetch news data.
        *   Update the NewsFeed component to use the new API.
    4.  **Code Splitting:**
        *   Identify areas where code splitting can be applied.
        *   Implement dynamic imports for these areas.
        *   Verify that code splitting is working correctly.
    5.  **Testing:**
        *   Write unit tests for core components.
        *   Write integration tests for key functionalities.
        *   Ensure that tests cover all critical code paths.
    6.  **Performance Optimization:**
        *   Use browser developer tools to profile the application.
        *   Identify performance bottlenecks.
        *   Optimize rendering performance and reduce resource consumption.
    7.  **Documentation:**
        *   Add comments to the code to explain complex logic.
        *   Update the README.md file with the latest changes.
        *   Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines for contributing to the project.

    ## Conclusion

    This refactoring plan provides a roadmap for improving the quality, maintainability, and performance of the F1 Stock Market Simulator. By following these steps, we can ensure that the application is robust, scalable, and easy to maintain.
